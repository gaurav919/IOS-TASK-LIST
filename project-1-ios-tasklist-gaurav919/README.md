Project Title : IOS taskList

My app is a simple todolist app. We can add new task by clicking the + sign on the right corner of screen. We can edit the list 
by clicking on the desired list. There is a swipe function too. We can swipe from left to right to mark the completition of the task and from right to left to 
delete the task. In the add page we can pick a date from a date picker. There is a toggle button also which we can use to show the completition or incompletition of the task. 

Special info:
In the app if we donot pick a date it will not add any date . But while shorting it will be added as the recent task.

lesson learned:
It was fun project. I learned a lot of things about how the app design process works. It was hard at the begining. Understanding the swift was hard . But once 
you spent countless of hours staring the code and googling the meaning of the code you will get a little bit of idea on how the code is working
